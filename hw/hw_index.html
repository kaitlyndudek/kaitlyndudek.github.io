<p>Hello my name is Kaitlyn Dudek. I'm from Buffalo, NY. I am from an island named Grand Island (there are technically two but I am from the one in NY and not NJ).If you think about it, everytime you go to Niagara Falls, you have to go over two bridges and an island, which just happens to be Grand Island. The reason I say all of this is because Grand Island one of the many small Buffalo towns so my every school I went to Grand Island Elementary School through Grand Island High School. It might seem cool but it is really not. The worst thing is the traffic. I did a lot of things in high school that I don't do anymore such as playing an instrument and soccer. Other than that, I would say that I love to read, play video games, and talk with my family. To be honest, that's pretty much it.</p>
